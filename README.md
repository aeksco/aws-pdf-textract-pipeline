# aws-pdf-textract-pipeline [![Mentioned in Awesome CDK](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/kolomied/awesome-cdk)


:mag: Data pipeline for crawling PDFs from the Web and transforming their contents into structured data using [AWS Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/). Built with AWS CDK + TypeScript.

This is an example data pipeline that illustrates one possible approach for large-scale serverless PDF processing - it should serve as a good foundation to modify for your own purposes.

**Getting Started**

Run the following commands to install dependencies, build the CDK stack, and deploy the CDK Stack to AWS.

```
yarn install
yarn build
cdk bootstrap
cdk deploy
```

### Overview

The following is an overview of each process performed by this CDK stack.

1. **Scrape PDF download URLs from a website**

   Scraping data from the [COGCC](https://cogcc.state.co.us/) website.

2. **Store PDF download URL in DynamoDB**

3. **Download the PDF to S3**

   A lambda fires off when a new PDF download URL has been created in DynamoDB.

4. **Process the PDF with AWS Textract**

   Another lambda fires off when a PDF has been downloaded to the S3 bucket.

5. **Process the AWS Textract results**

   When an SNS event is detected from AWS Textract, a lambda is fired off to process the result.

6. **Save the processed Textract result to DynamoDB.**

   After the full result is pruned down the the desired datastructure, we save the data in DynamoDB.

### Scripts

- `yarn install` - installs dependencies
- `yarn build` - builds the production-ready CDK Stack
- `yarn test` - runs Jest
- `cdk bootstrap` - bootstraps AWS Cloudformation for your CDK deploy
- `cdk deploy` - deploys the CDK stack to AWS

**Notes**

- **Warning** - the `AnalyzeDocument` process from AWS Textract costs \$50 per 1,000 PDF pages. Be careful when deploying this CDK stack as you could unintentionally rack up an expensive AWS bill quickly if you're not paying attention.

- If a PDF download URL has already been added to the `pdfUrlsTable` DynamoDB table, the pipeline will not re-execute for the PDF.

- Includes tests with Jest.

- Recommended to use `Visual Studio Code` with the `Format on Save` setting turned on.
